P^(Q^R) = (P^R)^R - So it is not ambiguous to say to write P^Q^R

2^n, where n is the number of variables, is the formula for calculating the number of rows in a truth table

P^QvR is ambiguous

=>  <--implication operator

iff -> If and Only If

If a Logic formula is equivalent to T, it's a tautology

Set Theory: foundation of mathematics

Set: a collection of objects

BIG12 = {OU, UT, OSU, KU, KSU, BU, WVU, ISU,...}
# of elements in the set is the cardinality of the set

Famous Sets:
1. Empty Set: {}
2. Natural Numbers: Set w/ numbers that (N>0 && N.floor == N)
3. Z: Natural Number, but with negatives
4. R: Real Numbers
5. Q: Rational Number
6. C: Complex Number
