P^(Q^R) = (P^R)^R - So it is not ambiguous to say to write P^Q^R

2^n, where n is the number of variables, is the formula for calculating the number of rows in a truth table

P^QvR is ambiguous

=>  <--implication operator

iff -> If and Only If

If a Logic formula is equivalent to T, it's a tautology

Set Theory: foundation of mathematics

Set: a collection of objects

BIG12 = {OU, UT, OSU, KU, KSU, BU, WVU, ISU,...}
Number of elements in the set is the cardinality of the set

Famous Sets:
1. Empty Set: {}
2. Natural Numbers: Set w/ numbers that (N>0 && N.floor == N)
3. Z: Integer
4. R: Real Numbers
5. Q: Rational Number
6. C: Complex Number

# Discrete Structures Note 5

Key things about Sets
- It cannot repeat itself
- Orderless

Power Set: A Power Set is a set containg all possible subsets, including the empty set
|P(A)| = 2^(A)

Symbols to Know:
- ∪ - Union - Joins two sets together. Elements don't repeat
- ∩ - Intersection - Only takes into account the elements that are in both sets
- - - Minus(?) - Takes away all elements of the first set that are in the second set
- ⊕ - Disjoint - Adds up the elements that are not in both sets (opposite of intersection)
- U - Universal Set - 
-
